DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CREATIVE STATISTIC:
Please be concise!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For custom mode, I have 4 creative statistics to show:

1. Total strikes number
2. Total strikes and spares number
3. Average bonus gathered after a strike
4. Average bonus gathered after a spare

Since strike and spare's bonus score are crucial for a player to win a game, the
more strikes or spares achieved in a game, the more better the player did in a
game. Hence, I choose total strikes number and total strikes & spares number as
a measurement of a player's performance.

Also, an important ability of a player for winning a game is the stability of
emotion. Since ten-pin bowling does not have match point as tennis, it's not
easy to measure how a player performs when he/she plays under high pressure.
Here, I use average bonus score gathered after a strike or a spare to measure
the stability of a player that I view a strike or a spare as match point.

Since I'm thinking this problem in a real game. The best dataset for this part
is 2010 US Open dataset. Any other similar dataset from a real game are perfect
for statistics in custom mode.
